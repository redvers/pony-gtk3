"""
A #GtkRecentFilter can be used to restrict the files being shown
in a #GtkRecentChooser.  Files can be filtered based on their name
(with gtk_recent_filter_add_pattern()), on their mime type (with
gtk_file_filter_add_mime_type()), on the application that has
registered them (with gtk_recent_filter_add_application()), or by
a custom filter function (with gtk_recent_filter_add_custom()).

Filtering by mime type handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of text/plain.
Note that #GtkRecentFilter allows wildcards for the subtype of a
mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/\*.

Normally, filters are used by adding them to a #GtkRecentChooser,
see gtk_recent_chooser_add_filter(), but it is also possible to
manually use a filter on a file with gtk_recent_filter_filter().

Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.

## GtkRecentFilter as GtkBuildable

The GtkRecentFilter implementation of the GtkBuildable interface
supports adding rules using the <mime-types>, <patterns> and
<applications> elements and listing the rules within. Specifying
a <mime-type>, <pattern> or <application> has the same effect as
calling gtk_recent_filter_add_mime_type(),
gtk_recent_filter_add_pattern() or gtk_recent_filter_add_application().

An example of a UI definition fragment specifying GtkRecentFilter rules:
|[
<object class="GtkRecentFilter">
  <mime-types>
    <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>
    <mime-type>image/png</mime-type>
  </mime-types>
  <patterns>
    <pattern>*.txt</pattern>
    <pattern>*.png</pattern>
  </patterns>
  <applications>
    <application>gimp</application>
    <application>gedit</application>
    <application>glade</application>
  </applications>
</object>
