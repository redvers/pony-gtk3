When setting multiple adjustment properties via their individual

However, since the emission of the #GtkAdjustment::changed signal
is tied to the emission of the #GObject::notify signals of the changed
properties, itâ€™s possible to compress the #GtkAdjustment::changed
signals into one by calling g_object_freeze_notify() and
g_object_thaw_notify() around the calls to the individual setters.

Alternatively, using a single g_object_set() for all the properties
to change, or using gtk_adjustment_configure() has the same effect
of compressing #GtkAdjustment::changed emissions.
